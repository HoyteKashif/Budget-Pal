# Budget-Pal

Java based budget application with a web-based component, MySql database with Wicket and TomEE.
-- this is a test bed application that I am using to test out different technologies and develpment strategies
-- I hope to make the backend side of the application work with json files so that it will not rely on database connectivity but instead share the data with a database at the users (mine for now) request.

-- specs and directions to get it up and running will soon be included.
-- currently working to do more research into personal financing as well as studying other applications to see where I can 
borrow from and possible improve upon.

Target release for the 1st version is December 1, 2017.
